##  Goals üó∫Ô∏è

Some time ago, I was interested on Typescript and building APIs with it, so I started a [NestJs course](https://github.com/kammradt/learning-nestjs). This project aims to apply what I learned, by creating a an API to a *[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) clone* that I'm calling **Let's meet!**



##  Description üìù

**Let's meet!** is a study project aiming to be a simpler version of [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/).

It will allow users to create, manage and organize events.
You can verify more below!
